#Wednesday-Ui

***Wednesday-Ui*** is a modular front-end framework. All ***Wednesday-Ui*** widgets and styles can be used completely independently of each other with the only dependency being ***jQuery***. Include as much or as little of library as you want.

Unlike ***jQuery-Ui*** or ***Bootstrap***, ***Wednesday-Ui*** comes with minimal styling leaving you to get on with writing the styles for your design without having to undo or overwrite lots of pre-defined styles. ***Wednesday-Ui*** also allows you to maintain complete semantic control of your markup with any pre-defined styles or widget styles added via mixins. ***Wednesday-Ui*** also comes with a 12 column responsive grid. Column styles are applied via mixins, thus completely removing presentational classes from your markup reducing clutter.

***Wednesday-Ui*** supports the following browsers. IE-8, IE-9, IE-10, Safari, Opera, Firefox and Chrome. Note the media-query based responsive grid will only work in IE-9 upwards without the use of a third party library like [respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) to polyfill media-query support.
